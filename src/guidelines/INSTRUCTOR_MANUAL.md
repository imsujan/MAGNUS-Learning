**LEARN → TRY → APPLY → ASSESS → REFLECT**

Let's break this down:

#### **1. LEARN** (10-20% of time)
- Watch video or read content
- Understand concepts and theory
- See demonstrations
- Review examples

**Your Role:** Explain clearly, show real examples, tell stories

#### **2. TRY** (20-30% of time)
- Guided practice exercises
- Follow-along tutorials
- Low-stakes experimentation
- Immediate feedback

**Your Role:** Provide step-by-step instructions, create safe practice space

#### **3. APPLY** (40-50% of time)
- Independent projects
- Real-world scenarios
- Problem-solving challenges
- Creative application

**Your Role:** Design realistic projects, provide frameworks, guide troubleshooting

#### **4. ASSESS** (10-15% of time)
- Quizzes to test understanding
- Project evaluations
- Self-assessments
- Peer reviews

**Your Role:** Create fair assessments, provide constructive feedback, set clear criteria

#### **5. REFLECT** (5-10% of time)
- What did I learn?
- How will I use this?
- What challenged me?
- What's next?

**Your Role:** Ask thought-provoking questions, encourage metacognition

---

### The 70-20-10 Learning Model

**70% Hands-On Practice**
- Learners spend most time DOING
- Building, coding, designing, solving
- Real projects, not just examples
- Mistakes are learning opportunities

**20% Social Learning**
- Discussion forums
- Peer reviews
- Study groups (future)
- Community interaction

**10% Formal Instruction**
- Video lectures
- Reading materials
- Demonstrations
- Theory and concepts

**⚠️ Common Mistake:** Most instructors spend 70% on lectures and 10% on practice. Flip this ratio!

---

### Backward Design Methodology

**Start with the END in mind:**

```
Step 1: Define the OUTCOME
↓
Step 2: Design the ASSESSMENT
↓
Step 3: Plan the INSTRUCTION
```

#### **Example: Revit Advanced Families Course**

**Step 1 - Desired Outcome:**
> "Learners can independently create complex parametric families for BIM projects, including nested families, conditional formulas, and type catalogs."

**Step 2 - Assessment Design:**
> Capstone Project: "Create a fully parametric furniture family (office desk) with multiple material options, size variations, and automatic component visibility based on parameters. Must include type catalog with 5+ configurations."

**Step 3 - Instruction Plan:**
> - Module 1: Family fundamentals (reference planes, parameters)
> - Module 2: Formulas and conditional logic
> - Module 3: Nested families
> - Module 4: Type catalogs
> - Module 5: Advanced techniques (arrays, shared parameters)
> - Module 6: Capstone project

**Notice:** We started with what learners need to CREATE, not what we want to TEACH.

---

## Defining Course Outcomes

### What Makes a Great Course Outcome?

**SMART Framework:**
- **Specific:** Clear and precise
- **Measurable:** Observable and testable
- **Achievable:** Realistic for skill level
- **Relevant:** Directly applicable to jobs/goals
- **Time-bound:** Achievable within course duration

### Bad vs. Good Course Outcomes

❌ **Bad:** "Get familiar with Revit"
✅ **Good:** "Model a complete architectural building in Revit (3-story residential), including walls, floors, roofs, doors, windows, stairs, and automatic schedules."

### Course Outcome Template

**By the end of this course, you will be able to:**

1. [Action Verb] + [What] + [How/Context] + [Quality Standard]
   - Example: "Design structural steel connections in Tekla using industry-standard detailing practices that pass engineering review."

2. [Action Verb] + [What] + [For what purpose] + [Portfolio artifact]
   - Example: "Create photorealistic renderings in Lumion for client presentations that showcase material quality and lighting design."

3. [Action Verb] + [Complex task] + [Real-world scenario]
   - Example: "Coordinate multi-discipline BIM models to detect conflicts before construction, reducing project change orders."

**Write 3-5 outcome statements for your course.**

### Micro-Lesson Strategy

**Break content into 5-15 minute chunks:**

**Why?**
- Maintains attention and focus
- Easier to fit into busy schedules
- Better retention (spacing effect)
- Allows precise progress tracking
- Reduces overwhelm

**How to Chunk Content:**

**❌ Wrong:**
- "Revit Family Creation (1 hour 45 min video)"

**✅ Right:**
- Lesson 1: "Creating the Family Template" (7 min)
- Lesson 2: "Setting Up Reference Planes" (10 min)
- Lesson 3: "Adding Parameters" (12 min)
- Lesson 4: "Creating Geometry" (15 min)
- Lesson 5: "Adding Conditional Formulas" (14 min)
- Lesson 6: "Testing Your Family" (8 min)

**Each lesson should cover ONE clear concept.**

### Module Naming Best Practices

**Be specific and action-oriented:**

❌ Generic: "Introduction"
✅ Specific: "Getting Started with Revit Interface"

❌ Vague: "Advanced Techniques"
✅ Clear: "Parametric Modeling for Complex Geometries"

❌ Boring: "Module 3"
✅ Engaging: "Building Your First BIM Project"

### Prerequisite Mapping

**Clearly define what learners need BEFORE starting:**

**Beginner Course:**
- Prerequisites: None (or basic computer skills)
- Starting assumption: No prior knowledge

**Intermediate Course:**
- Prerequisites: "Introduction to [Software]" OR "6 months industry experience"
- Starting assumption: Comfortable with basic tools and interface

**Advanced Course:**
- Prerequisites: "Intermediate [Topic]" + "Real project experience"
- Starting assumption: Can work independently, needs refinement

**📌 Pro Tip:** Include a "Prerequisites Check" quiz at the start so learners can self-assess readiness.

---

## Writing Learning Objectives

### Bloom's Taxonomy in Practice

Learning objectives describe what learners will be able to DO after completing a lesson/module.

**Bloom's Taxonomy Levels (Revised):**

```
Level 1: REMEMBER (Recall facts)
Level 2: UNDERSTAND (Explain concepts)
Level 3: APPLY (Use in new situations)
Level 4: ANALYZE (Break down and examine)
Level 5: EVALUATE (Judge and critique)
Level 6: CREATE (Design and build)
```

**For job-ready skills, focus on Levels 3-6 (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).**

### Action Verbs by Level

**Level 1: REMEMBER**
- Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Label, Match, Select

**Level 2: UNDERSTAND**
- Explain, Describe, Summarize, Paraphrase, Interpret, Classify, Compare

**Level 3: APPLY** ⭐ Start here for practical courses
- Use, Demonstrate, Execute, Implement, Operate, Solve, Calculate, Perform

**Level 4: ANALYZE** ⭐
- Examine, Investigate, Differentiate, Organize, Deconstruct, Diagnose, Test

**Level 5: EVALUATE** ⭐
- Assess, Critique, Judge, Justify, Validate, Verify, Recommend, Prioritize

**Level 6: CREATE** ⭐ Ultimate goal
- Design, Develop, Build, Construct, Plan, Produce, Compose, Generate

### Writing Effective Learning Objectives

**Formula:**
> By the end of this [lesson/module], you will be able to **[Action Verb]** + **[What]** + **[Context/How]** + **[Quality Criteria (optional)]**.

**Examples:**

**For a Revit Lesson:**
> "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to **create** **custom wall types** in Revit with multiple layers and assign material properties."

**For an AutoCAD Module:**
> "By the end of this module, you will be able to **produce** **complete construction drawings** including title blocks, viewports, and annotations that meet industry standards."

**For a Navisworks Lesson:**
> "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to **identify and categorize** **clash conflicts** between architectural and MEP models using Clash Detective."

### Poor vs. Strong Objectives

| ❌ Weak Objective | ✅ Strong Objective |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "Learn about layers in AutoCAD" | "Organize drawing elements using layers with proper naming conventions and color assignments" |
| "Understand BIM workflows" | "Execute a BIM coordination workflow from model federation to clash resolution and reporting" |
| "Know parametric design" | "Build parametric families in Revit with nested components and conditional visibility parameters" |
| "Be familiar with rendering" | "Produce photorealistic renderings using Lumion with custom materials, lighting, and post-processing effects" |

### Objective Hierarchy

**Course-Level Objectives** (3-5 big outcomes)
↓
**Module-Level Objectives** (2-4 outcomes per module)
↓
**Lesson-Level Objectives** (1-2 outcomes per lesson)

**Ensure alignment:** Lesson objectives → Module objectives → Course objectives

---

## Designing Hands-On Labs

### Why Hands-On Practice Matters

**The Learning Pyramid (retention rates):**
- Lecture: 5% retention
- Reading: 10% retention
- Audiovisual: 20% retention
- Demonstration: 30% retention
- **Practice by doing: 75% retention** ⭐
- **Teaching others: 90% retention** ⭐

**Your job: Get learners DOING, not just watching.**

### Types of Practice Activities

**1. Guided Practice (Follow-Along)**
- Instructor demonstrates step-by-step
- Learner pauses video and replicates
- Low complexity, high support
- Builds confidence

**Example:** "Follow along as I model this simple chair in Revit. Pause the video after each step and replicate on your own."

---

**2. Scaffolded Practice (Partially Complete)**
- Instructor provides starter files
- Learner completes missing portions
- Medium complexity, medium support
- Develops problem-solving

**Example:** "I've provided a partially complete Revit model. Your task: Add the missing windows and doors according to the floor plan provided."

---

**3. Independent Practice (From Scratch)**
- Learner builds entire solution
- Instructor provides requirements only
- High complexity, low support (but available)
- Tests true understanding

**Example:** "Create a complete staircase family with the following specifications: [list requirements]. Use the techniques from this module."

---

**4. Challenge Practice (Stretch Goals)**
- Advanced optional tasks
- Requires creative thinking
- No step-by-step instructions
- For motivated learners

**Example:** "Advanced Challenge: Can you modify this family to include automatic railing generation based on stair geometry? Hint: nested families."

### Lab Design Template

**Where to provide:**
- Upload to course resources section
- Link in lesson description
- Include in downloadable course package

---

## Building Quizzes & Assessments

### Assessment Philosophy

**Two types of assessments:**

**1. Formative Assessments** (Learning checkpoints)
- **Purpose:** Check understanding, provide feedback
- **Stakes:** Low (can retake unlimited times)
- **Placement:** After each lesson or module
- **Types:** Quick quizzes, knowledge checks
- **Feedback:** Immediate, with explanations

**2. Summative Assessments** (Prove mastery)
- **Purpose:** Evaluate overall competency
- **Stakes:** Medium (limited attempts)
- **Placement:** End of modules or course
- **Types:** Projects, comprehensive exams
- **Feedback:** Detailed, with improvement guidance

### Writing Effective Quiz Questions

#### **Multiple Choice Questions**

**Anatomy of a good MCQ:**

```
Question Stem: [Clear, specific question]

A) [Plausible distractor]
B) [Correct answer]
C) [Common misconception]
D) [Plausible distractor]

Explanation: [Why B is correct and why others are wrong]
```

**Example:**

**Question:** In Revit, which parameter type should you use if you want the value to be the same for all instances of a family type, but different between types?

A) Instance Parameter  
B) Type Parameter ✅  
C) Shared Parameter  
D) Global Parameter  

**Explanation:** Type Parameters are the same for all instances of a specific type, but can differ between types (e.g., all "36x80 Doors" have the same height, but "30x80 Doors" have a different height). Instance Parameters vary for each individual element. Shared Parameters are for scheduling, and Global Parameters control multiple families.

---

**MCQ Best Practices:**

✅ **Do:**
- Test understanding, not memorization
- Use real-world scenarios
- Make all options plausible
- Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above"
- Keep options similar in length
- Use clear, concise language

❌ **Don't:**
- Use trick questions
- Include obvious wrong answers
- Use double negatives
- Give hints through grammar (a/an inconsistencies)
- Make correct answer always "B" or "C"

---

#### **True/False Questions**

**Best for:** Testing specific facts or identifying misconceptions

**Example:**

**Question:** True or False: In AutoCAD, layers can be used to control both the visibility and the plotting of objects.

**Answer:** True ✅

**Explanation:** Layers in AutoCAD control multiple properties including visibility (on/off, freeze/thaw), plotting (plot/no plot), color, and linetype.

---

#### **Fill-in-the-Blank Questions**

**Best for:** Testing recall of terminology or specific values

**Example:**

**Question:** In Revit, the command to create a new family from scratch is found in the __________ menu.

**Answer:** File → New → Family (or "File" is acceptable)

**Grading:** Use flexible matching (accept variations, ignore capitalization)

---

#### **Matching Questions**

**Best for:** Testing understanding of relationships or categories

**Example:**

**Match the Revit family category to its typical use:**

1. Door Family          → A. Structural framing
2. Generic Model        → B. Opening in a wall
3. Structural Framing   → C. Custom non-standard geometry
4. Window Family        → D. Glazed openings

**Answers:** 1-B, 2-C, 3-A, 4-D

---

#### **Scenario-Based Questions (Applied Knowledge)**

**Best for:** Testing ability to apply knowledge to real situations

**Example:**

**Scenario:** You're working on a BIM coordination project and notice that HVAC ducts are clashing with structural beams in 15 locations. The structural engineer says the beams cannot be moved. What is the BEST next step?

A) Move the ducts to avoid the beams and update the MEP model  
B) Document the clashes and send a report to the project manager  
C) Contact the MEP engineer to discuss alternative routing solutions ✅  
D) Ignore the clashes as they will be resolved during construction  

**Explanation:** In BIM coordination, conflicts should be resolved collaboratively. The MEP engineer needs to be involved in finding alternative duct routes since they understand system requirements and constraints. Simply moving ducts without consultation could create other issues (flow restrictions, code violations, etc.).

---

### Quiz Design Guidelines

**Length:**
- **Knowledge Check (per lesson):** 3-5 questions, 2-5 minutes
- **Module Quiz:** 8-12 questions, 10-15 minutes
- **Comprehensive Exam:** 20-30 questions, 30-45 minutes

**Difficulty Distribution:**
- 30% Easy (recall, remember)
- 50% Medium (apply, analyze)
- 20% Hard (evaluate, create)

**Question Variety:**
- Mix question types (MCQ, T/F, scenario)
- Include visual questions (images, diagrams)
- Test different Bloom's levels

**Feedback Quality:**

❌ **Poor feedback:**
"Incorrect. The answer is B."

✅ **Good feedback:**
"Not quite. Type Parameters apply to all instances of a family type, while Instance Parameters can be different for each element. Review Lesson 2.3 for clarification on parameter types."

---

# Lesson 2.3: Creating Custom Parameters in Revit
## Video Transcript

[00:00 - 00:30] Introduction
Welcome back! In this lesson, we'll learn how to create custom parameters in Revit families. By the end, you'll be able to control family geometry using formulas and conditional logic.

[00:31 - 01:15] What Are Parameters?
Parameters are like variables in programming. They store values that control your family's behavior. There are two main types: Type parameters, which are the same for all instances of a family type, and Instance parameters, which can be different for each individual element.

### Lesson Notes/Summaries

**Provide scannable reference notes for quick review:**

```markdown
# Lesson 2.3 Summary: Custom Parameters in Revit

## Key Concepts
- **Parameter Types:**
  - Type Parameters: Same for all instances of a type
  - Instance Parameters: Unique to each element
  
- **Parameter Data Types:**
  - Text, Integer, Number, Yes/No, Length, Area, Volume, Angle, URL, Material

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Open Family Types Dialog**
   - Family Editor → Modify tab → Family Types button
   
2. **Create New Parameter**
   - Click "New" under Parameters section
   - Enter parameter name (use clear, descriptive names)
   - Select Type or Instance
   - Choose data type
   - Optionally assign to a parameter group

3. **Set Default Value**
   - Enter value in the Family Types dialog
   - Can use formulas (next lesson)

4. **Test Parameter**
   - Load family into project
   - Select element and check Properties panel
   - Modify value and observe changes

## Important Notes
⚠️ Parameter names cannot contain spaces (use underscores: Door_Width)  
💡 Use clear naming conventions for team collaboration  
✅ Always test parameters before sharing families  

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Creating instance parameters when type would be more appropriate (or vice versa)
- Using generic names like "Size" or "Value"
- Not organizing parameters into logical groups

## Practice Exercise
Create a simple box family with custom Width, Height, and Depth parameters. Make them Type parameters so all instances of "Small Box" have same dimensions.

## Next Lesson
Lesson 2.4: Formulas and Conditional Logic in Parameters
