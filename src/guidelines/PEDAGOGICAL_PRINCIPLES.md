# 🎓 Platform-Wide Pedagogical Principles
## Enforcing Excellence Across All AMD Courses

---

## Introduction

This document defines the instructional design philosophy and quality standards that ALL courses on the Aided Modelling with Design AMD platform must follow. These principles ensure consistency, learner success, and world-class educational quality.

**Purpose:**
- Guide instructors in creating effective courses
- Maintain platform-wide quality standards
- Ensure learner success across all content
- Differentiate AMD from competitors through pedagogical excellence

---

## Core Educational Philosophy

### Our Learning Commitment

**AMD Platform Promise:**
> "Every learner who completes an AMD course will gain job-ready skills through hands-on practice, real-world projects, and industry-aligned instruction—not just watch videos and take quizzes."

### Foundational Beliefs

1. **Skills Over Knowledge**
   - We teach what learners can DO, not just KNOW
   - Every course results in portfolio artifacts
   - Assessment measures performance, not recall

2. **Practice Over Lectures**
   - Learners spend majority of time building, creating, solving
   - Lectures are brief introductions to hands-on work
   - "Learning by doing" is mandatory, not optional

3. **Real-World Over Academic**
   - All content mirrors actual job tasks
   - Projects come from industry scenarios
   - Skills transfer immediately to workplace

4. **Inclusive Over Exclusive**
   - Courses accessible to learners of all backgrounds
   - Multiple pathways to success
   - Support for diverse learning needs

5. **Growth Over Fixed Mindset**
   - Mistakes are learning opportunities
   - Struggle is expected and supported
   - Mastery achieved through iteration

---

## Mandatory Pedagogical Framework

### 1. Backward Design Methodology

**ALL courses MUST use backward design:**

```
STEP 1: Define Desired Outcomes
↓
STEP 2: Design Valid Assessments
↓
STEP 3: Plan Learning Experiences
```

**Enforcement:**
- Course approval requires documented learning outcomes
- Outcomes must be measurable and job-aligned
- Assessments must directly measure stated outcomes
- Content audit checks alignment

**Quality Check Questions:**
- ❓ Can learners achieve the outcomes without certain lessons? (If yes, content is misaligned)
- ❓ Do assessments test what outcomes promise? (If no, assessment is invalid)
- ❓ Are outcomes skills that employers value? (If no, course lacks relevance)

---

### 2. Learn → Try → Apply → Assess → Reflect Model

**Every module MUST follow this structure:**

#### **LEARN (10-20% of time)**
*Purpose: Acquire foundational knowledge*

**What it includes:**
- Brief video explanations (5-15 min)
- Demonstrations with clear narration
- Conceptual understanding
- "Why this matters" context

**What it does NOT include:**
- Hour-long lectures
- Passive content consumption
- Theory without application

**Quality Standard:** Learner should say, "I understand the concept and am ready to try it."

---

#### **TRY (20-30% of time)**
*Purpose: Guided practice in safe environment*

**What it includes:**
- Step-by-step exercises
- Instructor-provided templates/starters
- Low-stakes practice
- Immediate feedback mechanisms

**What it does NOT include:**
- Being thrown into deep end without scaffolding
- High-stakes assessments at this stage
- Solo struggle without guidance

**Quality Standard:** Learner should say, "I can follow the process with guidance."

---

#### **APPLY (40-50% of time)** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
*Purpose: Independent skill demonstration*

**What it includes:**
- Real-world projects
- Open-ended challenges
- Creative problem-solving
- Multiple solution pathways

**What it does NOT include:**
- Cookbook recipes with one answer
- Disconnected from reality
- Artificial academic exercises

**Quality Standard:** Learner should say, "I can use this skill independently in new contexts."

---

#### **ASSESS (10-15% of time)**
*Purpose: Verify learning and provide feedback*

**What it includes:**
- Formative assessments (quizzes, knowledge checks)
- Summative assessments (projects, exams)
- Rubric-based evaluation
- Constructive feedback

**What it does NOT include:**
- Trick questions
- Subjective grading without criteria
- Assessment without feedback
- "Gotcha" tests

**Quality Standard:** Learner should say, "I know what I've mastered and what needs work."

---

#### **REFLECT (5-10% of time)**
*Purpose: Metacognitive awareness and transfer*

**What it includes:**
- Self-assessment questions
- Reflection prompts
- Application planning ("How will I use this?")
- Identifying growth areas

**What it does NOT include:**
- Skipping reflection entirely
- Generic "What did you learn?" questions
- No connection to future application

**Quality Standard:** Learner should say, "I understand my learning process and next steps."

---

### 3. The 70-20-10 Learning Model

**MANDATORY distribution across all courses:**

**70% Experiential Learning (Hands-On Practice)**
- Building, creating, solving, designing
- Projects and labs
- Real-world application
- Skill practice and repetition

**Enforcement Metric:** 
> Count total course time. Minimum 70% must be spent on hands-on activities, projects, and practice exercises.

**How to Measure:**
- If course claims "40 hours," at minimum 28 hours must be active practice
- Video lectures should not exceed 10-12 hours (25-30%)
- Assessments and reflection can be 2-4 hours (5-10%)

---

**20% Social Learning (Collaboration)**
- Discussion forums participation
- Peer review activities
- Group projects (future feature)
- Community knowledge sharing

**Enforcement Metric:**
> Every module must include discussion prompts and/or peer review components.

---

**10% Formal Learning (Instruction)**
- Video lectures
- Reading materials
- Demonstrations
- Theoretical concepts

**Enforcement Metric:**
> Total instructional video time should be ≤ 25% of claimed course duration.

---

**Common Violation:**

❌ **Wrong:**
- "Complete BIM Course - 40 hours"
- 35 hours of lecture videos
- 5 hours of quizzes
- 0 hours of hands-on projects

✅ **Correct:**
- "Complete BIM Course - 40 hours"
- 8 hours of lecture videos (20%)
- 28 hours of hands-on projects and labs (70%)
- 4 hours of discussions, assessments, reflection (10%)

---

### 4. Modular & Stackable Skill Blocks

**ALL courses must break content into micro-skills:**

**What This Means:**
- Each lesson teaches ONE discrete, measurable skill
- Skills can be learned independently (where appropriate)
- Skills combine to build competency
- Clear prerequisite relationships

**Structure Requirement:**

```
Skill Level 1 (Foundation)
├── Micro-skill 1.1
├── Micro-skill 1.2
└── Micro-skill 1.3
    ↓
Skill Level 2 (Intermediate)
├── Micro-skill 2.1 (requires 1.1, 1.2)
├── Micro-skill 2.2 (requires 1.3)
└── Micro-skill 2.3 (requires 2.1, 2.2)
    ↓
Skill Level 3 (Advanced)
└── Integration Project (requires all previous)
```

**Benefits:**
- Learners can skip skills they already have
- Courses can be modularized into learning paths
- Progress tracking is granular
- Personalized learning pathways possible

**Enforcement:**
- Course submission must include skill map
- Each skill must have clear learning objective
- Prerequisites must be documented

---
